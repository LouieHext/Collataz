# Collataz
Customisable Visualisation of the Collatz Conjecture. 

Calculates the collatz sequence for n intergers in a vectorised manner.
These are then visualied by curving th sequence depening on the parity of the current number and plotting 
the curved sequences.

Simply call the run function
run(N,a,b,scale)

N= desired number of integers
a,b = angles to rotate by
scale= step size

nice values are run(5000,0.3,0.265,10)
